# commonmark-markdown

## Goals of this repo

Just some test what commonmark markdown can do for me.

## Background

Today I decided to play around with commonmark, specifically for technical documentation. Commonmark supports mermaid inline diagramming so this will help me a lot in writing efficient technical documentation in e.g. README.md files.

Here are some articles where I draw my information from:

- [Github is now using CommonMark](https://talk.commonmark.org/t/github-is-now-using-commonmark-and-a-modified-version-of-cmark/2365)

## So what is it

The specification of Github-flavored-markdown can be found [here](https://github.com/github/cmark-gfm).
